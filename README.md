# Pokemon Gallery

> An HTTP server made with Node.js that serves a static index.html with a image gallery of Pokemon sprites and provides an endpoint to view personalized information of pokemons in JSON format using the fileSystem module. It consumes the primary data from different endpoints of the [pokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). 


## Built With

- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Node.js
- Axios

## Getting Started

`git clone git@github.com:jfoyarzo/Pokemon-gallery.git`

### Install
